## 📚 What's Inside

### 🧠 Core ML Libraries
- `NumPy` – Arrays, matrix operations, broadcasting
- `Pandas` – DataFrames, filtering, grouping, cleaning
- `Scikit-learn` – Regression, classification, model evaluation
- `PyTorch` – Neural networks, tensors, training loops
- `TensorFlow` / `Keras` – Layers, loss functions, optimizers
- `XGBoost` / `LightGBM` – Boosting for tabular data
- `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn` – Visualization basics

### 👁️ Computer Vision
- `OpenCV` – Image loading, color conversion, basic filters
- `Pillow` – Image editing
- `Torchvision` – Datasets, transforms, pre-trained models
- `Albumentations` – Image augmentations
- `YOLO` / `Detectron2` / `MMDetection` (optional advanced section)

### 🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- `NLTK` – Tokenization, stemming, classic NLP
- `spaCy` – Named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging
- `Hugging Face Transformers` – Sentiment analysis, text classification
- `TextBlob` – Simple NLP tasks (sentiment, noun phrases)
- `Gensim` – Word2Vec, topic modeling
- `SentenceTransformers` – Embedding sentences for similarity/search
